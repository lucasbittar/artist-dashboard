# Artist Dashboard

I started building this project to help my body-piercer friend to manage her clients. She was always forgetting about her appointments so I decided to help her out.
This dashboard mainly schedules appointments and the neat part is that it also adds a new event to her Google Calendar that way she gets notified and all that jazz.

Still a work in progress. My idea is to make this accessible to any artist so they can sign up and have their own dashboard to manager their own clients and appointments.
